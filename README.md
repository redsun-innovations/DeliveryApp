Delivery App

This Flutter application is designed for managing deliveries. It uses the deliverytemplate package.

Usage
To use the deliverytemplate package:

1) Ensure you have added the package to your project:

   Run this commant :  flutter pub add deliverytemplate


2) Import the necessary package in your Dart file:

    import 'package:deliverytemplate/main.dart';

 
 3) Set OrderListPage as the home page in your Flutter app:

      MaterialApp(
       home: const OrderListPage(),
       );

This sets OrderListPage from the deliverytemplate package as the main interface of your application.
